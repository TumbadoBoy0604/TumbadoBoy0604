## Selected Projects

### 🔹 [Gototion](https://github.com/Gototion/TAIA_Gototion)

A Telegram-based agent that integrates with Notion databases to automate task logging and management.  
The system reduces friction in daily task tracking while maintaining structured and consistent records across databases.

---

### 🔹 [MeDA Challenge 2025](https://github.com/TumbadoBoy0604/MEDA_Challenge)

Project developed for the MeDA competition at MICAI, focused on domain adaptation from general medical images (MedMNIST) to endoscopic imagery.  
The proposed approach achieved strong performance, securing **1st place at the national level**.
